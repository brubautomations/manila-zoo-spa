[CONSERVATION EFFORTS]

Rehabilitation: The zoo reopened in late 2022 after a multi-billion peso renovation. It now features a state-of-the-art Sewage Treatment Plant that prevents pollution into Manila Bay.

Mission: We act as an urban botanical sanctuary, a massive carbon sink for the city, and a rescue/breeding center for endemic species like the Philippine Eagle and Tamaraw.
